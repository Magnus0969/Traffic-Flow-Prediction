# Traffic Flow Prediction using SARIMA Model

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and forecast traffic flow using the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. The dataset comprises traffic flow data collected from multiple junctions, with a focus on daily vehicle counts at Junction 1.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for various stages of the project, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SARIMA modeling, model evaluation, and forecasting.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for each stage of the project, providing a programmatic approach to the analysis.
- **images/**: Visualizations and plots generated during the analysis.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the dependencies using:
```bash
